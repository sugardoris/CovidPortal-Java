# CovidPortal-Java
I made this project for the Java class I took in college. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the knowledge we have gained throughout the semester, starting from the basic concepts:
- encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- abstract classes, interfaces
- exception handling
- collections (lists, sets, maps)
- I/O, working with files
- Javadocs, logging

It also covers some intermediate and more advanced topics:
- generic programming
- functional programming and lambdas
- JavaFX and SceneBuilder
- JDBC and working with databases
- concurrency and threads
